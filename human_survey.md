## Simplified Experimental Design for Human Survey to Validate Question Metrics (Utility vs. Saliency vs. EIG)

### Objective:

Quickly validate the correlation between QUEST-generated question metrics (Utility, Saliency, and Expected Information Gain - EIG) and human perception of question quality through a small-scale pilot study.

---

### Participants:

* **Target Demographic:** University students familiar with the tested subjects.
* **Sample Size:** Around 10 participants total.
* **Recruitment:** ?

---

### Experimental Procedure:

#### Phase 1: Brief Exposure to Learning Material

* Participants read 1–2 short textbook sections.
* Participants receive sets of three questions, each identified as:

  * High Utility (QUEST)
  * High Saliency
  * High Expected Information Gain (EIG)

#### Phase 2: Short Post-Test Assessment

* Participants answer 2–3 questions directly linked to the previously read sections to gauge understanding.

#### Phase 3: Subjective Evaluation

* Participants rate each question individually on:

  * **Usefulness**: How useful was each question for understanding the section? (1-5 scale)
  * **Preference**: Rank the three questions from most to least preferred.

* Provide quick open-ended feedback to describe their experience and rationale for preferences.
---

### Data Analysis:

* Evaluate subjective ratings and ranking preferences among the metrics.

---

### Hypothesis:

Participants will rate high-utility questions as more useful compared to questions selected based on high saliency or high EIG.

---

### Ethical Considerations:

* Ensure informed consent and confidentiality.

---

### Implementation Timeline:

* **Preparation & Recruitment:** 1 week
* **Experiment Execution:** 1–2 weeks
* **Data Analysis & Reporting:** 1 week

Total Estimated Duration: 3–4 weeks.
